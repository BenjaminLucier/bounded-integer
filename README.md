This crate provides two types of bounded integer for use in Rust.

## Macro-generated bounded integers

The [`bounded_integer!`] macro allows you to define your own bounded integer type, given a
specific range it inhabits. For example:

```rust
bounded_integer! {
    struct MyInteger { 0..8 }
}
let num = MyInteger::new(5).unwrap();
assert_eq!(num, 5);
```

This macro supports both `struct`s and `enum`s. See the [`examples`] module for the
documentation of generated types.

## Const generics-based bounded integers

You can also create ad-hoc bounded integers via types in this library that use const generics,
for example:

```rust
let num = <BoundedU8<0, 7>>::new(5).unwrap();
assert_eq!(num, 5);
```

These integers are shorter to use as they don't require a type declaration or explicit name,
and they interoperate better with other integers that have different ranges. However due to the
limits of const generics, they do not implement some traits like `Default`.

## `no_std`

All the integers in this crate depend only on libcore and so work in `#![no_std]` environments.

## Crate Features

By default, no crate features are enabled.
- `std`: Implement traits from `std`, such as [`Error`] on [`ParseError`].
- `macro`: Enable the [`bounded_integer!`] macro.
- `types`: Enable the bounded integer types that use const generics.
- `arbitrary`: Implement [`Arbitrary`] for the bounded integers. This is useful when using
bounded integers as fuzzing inputs.
- `bytemuck`: Implement [`Contiguous`] for all bounded integers, and [`Zeroable`] for
macro-generated bounded integers that support it.
- `serde`: Implement [`Serialize`] and [`Deserialize`] for the bounded integers, making sure all
values will never be out of bounds.
- `step_trait`: Implement the [`Step`] trait which allows the bounded integers to be easily used
in ranges. This will require you to use nightly and place `#![feature(step_trait)]` in your
crate root if you use the macro.
